🔍 Face Detection & Recognition in Python
A simple yet powerful implementation of face detection and recognition using Python. This project demonstrates how to identify faces in images and recognize individuals using facial features.

📸 What This Project Does
     - Detects faces in a given image.
     - Recognizes known faces by comparing facial features.
     - Uses pre-trained models with face_recognition and OpenCV.
🤖 Technologies Used
     - Python 3.7+
     - face_recognition
     - opencv-python
✨ Key Concepts

. Face Detection :- Locates faces in images using deep learning models. | 
. Face Recognition:-Compares facial encodings to known identities. | 
. Embeddings:- Converts faces into numeric vectors for easy comparison. | 

🔧 Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


📷 Add Your Images
    - Place known faces in the known/ directory.
    - Test images go into the test/ directory.
🧪 Usage
Here’s a simple example using the code:
